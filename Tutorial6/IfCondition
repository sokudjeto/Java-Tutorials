note:
assigning equality is different from testing for equality
assigning is set something to be something. e.g i = 1
test for equality is to see if something is the same as another object e.g 5==5
assigning is due with a single equal sign
testing is done with double equal sign

if statements are mutually exclusive. This means that if the first condition is true
then it ignores the rest of the else/else if condition.
