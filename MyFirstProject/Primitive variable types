Java has 8 primitive types of variables
the variable int is a 32 bit variable in java
the variable short is a 16 bit variable type in java, does not hold as much as int
another variable is long, it holds more values and its 64 bit
double is used for double precision, like decimals
a float is a short version of double, but java by default uses double, to indicate float, u must end the value with an "f"
the char variable holds characters
the boolean variable holds only 2 values; either a true/false or yes or no.
the last one is byte, which holds 8 bytes of data or +-127 (128-1) digit, useful to hold an array of data which u want to know the load
